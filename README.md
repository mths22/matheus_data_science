# 👋 Hi, I'm Matheus

Hello! I'm Matheus, a 22-year-old recent Business graduate who is passionate about data and how powerful it can be for making smarter business decisions.  

This GitHub profile is where I showcase projects that demonstrate my skills in data science and data analysis. Most of my work is done using **Python**, which is the language I feel most comfortable with when wrangling and analyzing data.

## 📁 What You’ll Find Here

Each repository contains a `README.md` file explaining:
- The **goal** of the project
- The **dataset** used
- The **main takeaways** and **insights** I gained

I usually divide my projects into **Jupyter notebooks** that reflect the typical data workflow:
1. Data Cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Preprocessing  
4. Modeling  
5. Interpretation of Results

I use Git for version control and push all updates from my local `.git` folder to GitHub through the terminal using standard Git commands.
